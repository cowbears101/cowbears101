@cowbears101 here.

I'm interested in a crap ton of stuff, ranging from developing/modifying minecraft shader packs 
and mods to dabbling in game devlopment. I also try out programming in a bunch of different languages, none of which I'll specify.

If you're trying to reach me for some reason, you'll have to contact me on discord-- lamp#0256
